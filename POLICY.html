            <p>1.HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR MARKETING
            </p>

            <p>&#8226; Information you give us. When we collect personal data from you through our website, when you or
                your organisation registers as a client on our platform or when you or your organisation registers as an
                expert on our platform, we will collect your contact details and ask you to tick a box to say if you are
                happy to receive marketing from us.
            </p>
            <p>If you agree to it, we will use your personal data to send you marketing in the ways you have agreed that
                we can contact you. We will send you marketing about our products and services, offers that we have on,
                competitions that you can take part in, and events that may interest you.
            </p>
            <p>1.OUR LEGAL BASIS FOR SENDING YOU MARKETING
            </p>
            <p>Our legal basis for sending you marketing is that you have consented to receiving marketing from us.
            </p>
            <p>You can change your mind about receiving marketing from us at any time by contacting us by email:
                fly@ HIGHWAY AVIATION.com, by phone +44 (0) 20 8616 8821 or by writing to us at: HIGHWAY AVIATION, 3rd
                Floor,
                91-93 Buckingham Palace Road, London, SW1W 0RP, or by following the unsubscribe links in our marketing
                emails.
            </p>
            <p>HOW LONG WE WILL KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA
            </p>
            <p>We will not keep your personal data for longer than we need it for the purposes we have explained in this
                privacy policy.
            </p>
            <p>We will keep the personal data that you provide and that we collect or receive in relation to your
                account when you or your organisation registers as a client or expert on our platform for six years from
                the date our contract with you ends.
            </p>
            <p>We will keep the personal data you provide or we collect or receive in relation to queries you make about
                our platform but where you do not end up registering for our platform at that point for two years after
                the end of our communications with you, in case you get back in touch with us at a later date for
                further information, so we can refer back to our previous discussions with you.
            </p>
            <p>Where we have collected your personal data for marketing, we will keep it for two years from the date you
                give your consent to receiving marketing from us, or until you withdraw your consent to receiving
                marketing from us.
                If a dispute arises between us, we will continue to retain your personal data for the purposes of
                responding to and dealing with any such dispute.
            </p>
            <p>1.TRANSFER of personal data OUTSIDE THE European Economic Area
            </p>
            <p>We store your personal data in the United Kingdom or in countries within the European Economic Area.
            </p>
            <p>If we do transfer your personal data outside the EEA, we would only do so where we have a legal basis for
                doing so and where we ensure that your personal data is protected to the same standard as it would be
                protected in the UK. We would do this by entering into data sharing agreements with the recipients of
                your personal data based outside the EEA which comply with the EU Commission’s standard clauses for the
                transfer of personal data outside the EEA.
            </p>
            <p>Please contact us for further information as to the transfer of your personal data outside the EEA, and
                if we are doing so on the basis of the EU’s standard clauses, you can ask us for a copy of those
                clauses: by email: fly@ HIGHWAY AVIATION.com, by phone +44 (0) 20 8616 8821 or by writing to us at:
                HIGHWAY AVIATION, 3rd Floor, 91-93 Buckingham Palace Road, London, SW1W 0RP.
            </p>
            <p>YOUR RIGHTS OVER YOUR PERSONAL DATA
            </p>
            <p>The law gives you certain rights over your personal data that we hold:
            </p>
            <p>&#8226; You have a right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO),
                the UK authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk).
            </p>
            <p>&#8226; You have a right to ask us what personal data we hold about you and to have a copy of the
                personal data that we hold about you.

            </p>
            <p>&#8226; You have a right to request that we correct any errors in your personal data.
            </p>
            <p>&#8226; You have a right to ask us to delete your personal data where: (I) we do not need your personal
                data anymore; (ii) you have asked us to review and explain our legitimate interests to you and we do not
                actually have a valid legitimate interest to do what we are doing; (iii) our use of your personal data
                is illegal; (iv) we have to delete your personal data to comply with our legal obligations.
            </p>
            <p>&#8226; Where (I) we have your personal data on the basis of your consent or because we need it to
                perform our contract with you; (ii) you provided your personal data to us; and (iii) we process your
                personal data by automated means, you have the right to ask us to give you a copy of your personal data
                in a commonly used, electronic format.
            </p>
            <p>&#8226; You have the right to ask us to review and explain our legitimate interests to you and to object
                to our legitimate interests.
            </p>
            <p>&#8226; Where our use of your personal data is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw that
                consent at any time.
            </p>
            <p>&#8226; You have the right to ask us to restrict our uses of your personal data where: (I) you do not
                think the personal data we have about you is correct, so that we can check if it is correct; (ii) what
                we are doing with your personal data is illegal but you would rather we stop using your personal data
                rather than delete it; (iii) we do not need your personal data anymore, but you need us to keep it so
                that you can exercise any legal rights; and/or (iv) you have asked us to review and explain our
                legitimate interests to you, so that we can check whether we actually have a valid legitimate interest
                to do what we are doing.
            </p>
            <p>If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us by email: HIGHWAY AVIATION.com, by
                phone +44 (0) 20 8616 8821 or by writing to us at: HIGHWAY AVIATION, 3rd Floor, 91-93 Buckingham Palace
